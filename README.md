# ML & DL Algorithms — From Scratch

This repository contains **mathematical derivations** and **from-scratch implementations** of popular Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.  
The goal is to help you understand *how* these algorithms work internally — not just how to use them.

Whether you're preparing for ML interviews, revising fundamentals, or genuinely curious about the math behind AI, this repo will guide you step-by-step.
